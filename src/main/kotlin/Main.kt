/**
 * Our actual representation of the MOS6502 processor chip.
 *
 * This entity just holds the general registers and the status flags.
 *
 * The status flags are treated as individual variables. In the future we can
 * treat then as a single 8-bit/byte, if needed.
 *
 * This entity can also execute instructions contained in the passed [memory],
 * through the function [executeNext].
 *
 * The if we have a binary program properly loaded in that memory, we can start
 * executing it using this class.
 *
 * The start of execution is based on the [PC] ("program count") variable,
 * which represents the actual position on memory that this entity will look for
 * an instruction "opcode".
 *
 * An "opcode" is basically a number (hexadecimal number) which is used to
 * identify an instruction itself. In this simulator, the instructions are just
 * Kotlin functions that are called based on that opcode checking.
 *
 * Instructions also exists in different addressing modes. In terms of assembly
 * programming each instruction has only a single identifier, that we can refer
 * as their "mnemonic label". E.g.: exists a instruction to sum a number with
 * some previously stored number called "add with carry". In assembly mnemonics
 * this instruction is called "ADC", however, this instruction can be executed
 * in a lot of different addressing modes, for example, "ADC" can be in
 * "immediate mode" or "absolute mode". Each variant is designed by a different
 * opcode. In this example we have "0x69" and "0x6D", respectively. This means
 * that either "0x69" either "0x6D" points to the "same" instruction, that is
 * the "ADC" one.
 *
 * Addressing modes are just different ways of retrieving the value that the
 * instruction will use in its calculation. For example, we can obtain this
 * "operand" value just next of the instruction opcode or in other regions
 * of the memory. Each mode describes its rules of how to obtain the operand
 * number.
